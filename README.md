# About this branch

* Steven also gives you the Mega Stone for your starter on Route 120
* TMs and Mega Stones are as close to their ORAS locations as possible, except for a few (mainly Mirage Spot ones)
* Wallace is a Gym Leader again (sorry Juan) and Steven's the Champion
* Changed regi sprites to their doll sprites (they just look more accurate!)

### Changes (Planned)
* Soaring encounters
* Soaring music
* Update Frontier Pokemon
* PWT Fixes and Improvements
* Mass outbreak changes
* Ways to change forms (eg. Deoxys, Rotom)
* Fix up followers
* Do something for legendaries

### Bugs
* Any known pokeemerald-expansion bug
* Followers don't have the correct reflection palette if they come out next to a reflective surface (probably from me messing with their palette system)
* In the PWT the info cards will say that Gym Leaders won with a move none of their Pok√©mon have.
* The overworld ash and snow weather effects will occasionally use the wrong palette.
